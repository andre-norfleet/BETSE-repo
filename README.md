# BETSE-repo
 betse repository final
 
 The ability to successfully run pipeline requires Matlab, Anaconda, WEKA, and CellProfiler; The repository is comprised of two main sections: 

•	Quantitative Image Analysis and Pattern Recognition

•	Parameter Optimization

The data and code pertaining to the ‘Quantitative Image Analysis and Pattern Recognition’ section is stored in the ‘../QuantitativeImageAnalysis/’ sub-directory and the data and code pertaining to ‘Parameter Optimization’ is stored in the ‘../temp_synthesis/’ sub-directory. Instructions to run the code are located in the ‘BETSE-repo/BETSE GitHub Instructions.docx’ file. The raw scRNA-sequencing data is located in the '../single cell RNA Seq data/' sub-directory, with the processed samples being located within the '../single cell RNA Seq data/Andre scRNAseq/' sub-directory in excel spreadsheets (.xlsx) in accordance with phenotype (PP-pluripotent, CM-cardiac mesoderm, CP-cardiac progenitor) and media treatment conditions (U vs. T, or untreated vs treated, respectively). The majority of analysis in this study was conducted on the untreated pluripotent sample.
